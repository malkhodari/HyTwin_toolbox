## üî¨ Details on HyperScore and HyperTrajectory modelling
```
- Hypertension is a serious medical condition that affects over a billion people worldwide
- The proper management of disease progression requires an extended knowledge on the functional/structural changes in the whole body in response to hypertension
- We developed the HyperScore; an integrative and unified measure of hypertension progression relative to multi-organ damage
- The HyperScore reflects the proximity of a participant from the healthy state and towards the diseased state [score range: 0 (low risk) ‚Äì 1 (high risk)]
- We provide another level of characterization of the progression mechanism by locating the participant on a disease progression trajectory map, HyperTrajectory
- Each trajectory within the map reflects distinct hypertension-related end-organ progression pathway
- Trajectory 1: Cardiac disease, Trajectory 2: Lipoprotein diseases, Trajectory 3: Atherothrombotic diseases
- Trajectory 4: Brain diseases, Trajectory 5: Mortality, Trajectory 6: Liver Diseases
- The built-in model was developed using a large participating cohort from the UK Biobank database (n=27,099) with over 500 imaging/non-imaging variables from multiple modalities.
- It is based on a semi-supervised machine learning approach; the contrastive trajectory inference (cTI)
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Usage instructions
```
- Input dataset should be arranged to match the data provided in this example (demographics.csv and multimodality.csv)
- Once loading the demographics.csv file, the tool will arrange the multimodality.csv based on Patient IDs (row-wise)
- If no Patient IDs are provided, they will be refered to as numbers, i.e., 1, 2, 3, ... etc
- If Patient IDs are provided on one of the .csv files only, the other will be assumed to follow the same order
- The tool works with missing demographic variables, however, they will be replaced by NaN
- Ensure providing age, sex, and BP, if possible, if plots are required
- Ensure the inclusion of at least the UK Biobank variable id, i.e., 12338, in the name of each variable
- Variable names will be edited automatically to match with the built-in names within the tool, i.e., X12338_2_0
- The tool checks for missing variables in the dataset (please make sure to have all variables available!)
- The tool runs with missing variables, however, it would be more accurate if all variables were provided!
- Missing values will be imputed automatically using the big data (UKBiobank) at the back-end of the tool
- Run the trajectory inference to estimate HyperScores and predict the proper trajectory for each patient
- The overall analysis of the input dataset will be visualized on the right panel
- The user has the option to visualize the analysis for each patient separately as well
- Once done, the user can export all results (table and figures) as .csv and .png, respectively
```
